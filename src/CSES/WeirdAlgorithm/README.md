# Collatz Algorithm Simulation

## Problem Description

Consider an algorithm that takes a positive integer `n` as input. 
If `n` is even, the algorithm divides it by two; if `n` is odd, 
the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. 
This process repeats until `n` becomes one. 
The task is to simulate the execution of this algorithm for a given value of `n` 
and print all values of `n` during the process.

3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
### Example

**Input:**

3

**Output:**

3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
